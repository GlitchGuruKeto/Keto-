## About Me
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Keto, a passionate computer science student with a love for coding, movies, and all things tech. When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll often find me exploring the great outdoors, taking leisurely walks with my furry friends, or indulging in a thrilling zombie flick.

## Interests
- **Computer Science**: I'm currently studying computer science and have a keen interest in software development, algorithms, and problem-solving.
- **Movies**: I'm a huge movie buff and enjoy watching a wide range of genres, from action-packed blockbusters to thought-provoking indie films.
- **Walking Animals**: There's nothing quite like a peaceful stroll with my four-legged companions. Whether it's a leisurely walk in the park or an adventurous hike in the mountains, I love spending time outdoors with my furry friends.
- **Zombies**: As a fan of the undead genre, I'm always up for a good zombie movie or TV show. There's something strangely captivating about the apocalyptic world of zombies and survival.
